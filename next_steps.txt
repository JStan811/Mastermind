Necessary:
  - feedback engine does not account for duplicates. I could solve this by hardstopping duplicate entry during guess phase, or setting something up during feedback phase(eg if white already exists for this number, do not place another one)
    - so this is actually currently solved the first way (hardstopping duplicate entries)
  - create super and subclasses (super player - sub human and sub computer, super board, super peg, super game - sub player guesses and sub computer guesses)
  - pull game loop and new game functionality out of main.rb and push into one or more classes
  - finish working on computer_change_guess method in game_computer_guesses.rb then delete computer_change_guess_only_black
  - replace game_computer_guesses.rb:10 with code collecting user input
  - rubocop it all boy!!
  - (At the end) update README with skills demonstrated

Optional:
  - peg entry limited to only 1-6. Should I use colors or letters instead?
  - if black on feedback board is earned, should that position get set automatically the next round? should that feedback board position get locked?
  - the display could be prettier...
  - add support for duplicates and blanks
  - move next steps into github issues?
