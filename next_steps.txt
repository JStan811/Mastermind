Necessary:
  - feedback engine does not account for duplicates. I could solve this by hardstopping duplicate entry during guess phase, or setting something up during feedback phase(eg if white already exists for this number, do not place another one)
    - so this is actually currently solved the first way (hardstopping duplicate entries)
  - create super and subclasses (super player - sub human and sub computer, super board, super peg, super game - sub player guesses and sub computer guesses)
  - finish working on computer_change_guess method in game_computer_guesses.rb then delete computer_change_guess_only_black
  - change all entries in a board to be a peg object? (or just get rid of peg objects entirely?)
  - rubocop it all boy!!
  - (At the end) update README with skills demonstrated

Optional:
  - peg entry limited to only 1-6. Should I use colors or letters instead?
  - if black on feedback board is earned, should that position get set automatically the next round? should that feedback board position get locked?
  - improve display (create some kind of board design?)
  - improve text (eg "Computer guesses: ")
  - add support for duplicates and blanks
  - move next steps into github issues?
