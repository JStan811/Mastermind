  - feedback engine does not account for duplicates.(eg if white already exists for this number, do not place another one)
  - rubocop cleanup
  - add support for duplicates and blanks
  - change how feedback board works (I think I misunderstood it :( Its not a board that corresponds per position to the code board, you just get a number of feedback pegs back. IE you might get 2 blacks and 2 whites, meaning 2 of your colors are in the right position, but it doesn't tell you which ones)
  - peg entry limited to only 1-6. Should I use colors or letters instead?
  - if black on feedback board is earned, should that position get set automatically the next round? should that feedback board position get locked?
  - improve display (create some kind of board design?)
  - improve text
  - move next steps into github issues?
  - (At the end) update README with skills demonstrated and lessons learned. May also be worth making a note about how the project could be improved in these ways:...
