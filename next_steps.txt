- notes from testing:
  - no limits on peg entry (rn anything not 1-6 is accepted).
  - peg entry limited (hehe) to only 1-6. Should I use colors or letters instead?
  - if black on feedback board is earned, should that position get set automatically the next round? should that feedback board position get locked?
  - feedback engine does not account for duplicates. I could solve this by hardstopping duplicate entry during guess phase, or setting something up during feedback phase(eg if white already exists for this number, do not place another one)
  - how can I have the guesser (or maker) set their board in one prompt rather than 4?
    - complete :)
  - currently the code is prompted for rather than randomly chosen by the computer
    - complete :)
  - the display could be prettier...
  - there's no lose message, just Game over.
