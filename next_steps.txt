- peg entry limited to only 1-6. Should I use colors or letters instead?
- if black on feedback board is earned, should that position get set automatically the next round? should that feedback board position get locked?
- feedback engine does not account for duplicates. I could solve this by hardstopping duplicate entry during guess phase, or setting something up during feedback phase(eg if white already exists for this number, do not place another one)
  - so this is actually currently solved the first way (hardstopping duplicate entries)
- the display could be prettier...
- no new game
